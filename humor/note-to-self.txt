This is a note to myself on server configuration. I'm putting it here so that it's relatively out-of-the-way and yet completely backed up.

To get sslforfree certs to work with Gitlab, verify the domain by adding TXT entries in the Namecheap control panel. You can verify that the entries have been added with `dig -t txt`. Note that it may take like an hour for sslforfree to recognize the entries.

In Gitlab Pages settings, go to the first box: copy in the SSL cert, a blank line, and then the CA Bundle. In the second box, copy the private key. After waiting a few minutes, HTTPS should work.

Troubleshooting:
Test stuff in SSLLabs (https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html)
