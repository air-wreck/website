# THOUGHTS

This is a space for me to post little thoughts that aren't fleshed-out
enough to put on my [blog](https://blog.ericzheng.org) and that I don't
intend to build on over time as I would a wiki page. Consider it a
stream from my head to the Internet. It's heavily inspired by Bandur's
[fragments](https://brandur.org/fragments).
