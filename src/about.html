      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Eric. I currently go to school in Pittsburgh. Before that, I
        grew up in New Jersey. I guess my life is mostly dominated by
        math and computers now. Maybe you came here to learn more about
        me, in which case I'm sorry to say that I'm really not that
        exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's the point of a personal website? I don't expect very many
        people to read these words; if I wanted readers, I would be on
        Twitter or Facebook instead. I don't expect to have very much
        interesting stuff to write, and I don't expect to aggressively
        promote flashy projects to potential employers. I guess you
        could say that this website has some utility as a landing page
        for my online presence, but in the end I think I mostly maintain
        it as a means of self-expression. The romantic view of it is
        that this is my little message in a bottle that I'm setting
        adrift in a vast digital ocean. The pragmatic view of it is that
        it'll almost certainly sink to the bottom of the sea.
      </p>

        Hm, that sounded a bit mushy. Maybe I should avoid writing at
        5:00 am and go to sleep instead.
