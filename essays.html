      <h1>Essays ("Good Reads")</h1>
      <p>Here is a collection of essays, articles, etc. that I found interesting/funny/whatever at the time that I read them. I'll hopefully expand this list over the years.</p>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h2>In solidarity with Library Genesis and Sci-Hub</h2>
      <em>multiple signatories, 2015 (<a href="http://custodians.online">link</a>)</em>
      <p>This is a thoughtful open letter about the current academic publishing crisis.</p>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h2>The Right to Read</h2>
      <em>Richard Stallman, 1997 (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html#content">link</a>)</em>
      <p>Stallman is known for being a bit of an idealist with some of his views, but it's a little scary to see how much of what he wrote twenty years ago has come true. His predictions in this short story have been right so far; it's chilling to think what will come to pass if they continue to be right.</p>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h2>Are Software Patents Evil?</h2>
      <em>Paul Graham, 2006 (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html">link</a>)</em>
      <p>While this essay is overall geared toward people who would like to found startups (Graham is a founder of Y Combinator, after all), it's a pretty interesting read. In a topic that's mired with passionate arguments over ideals, this essay takes a very practical approach to the matter (although there is some nice theoretical discussion toward the end). Actually, a lot of Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a> are worth reading (e.g. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html">this</a> or <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">this</a>).</p>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h2>We Should All Have Something to Hide</h2>
      <em>Moxie Marlinspike, 2013 (<a href="https://moxie.org/blog/we-should-all-have-something-to-hide/">link</a>)</em>
      <p>This is a very nice rebuttal to the reasonable question: "if I don't have anything to hide, why should I be concerned about mass surveillance?" Not only do we all have something to hide, but we <em>should</em>; being able to break the law is important, and if the police could solve every crime, we'd just be living in a police state. The stories posted on this site are also worth perusing, if you have the time.</p>
