# website

Just the source for my personal website. I used to host this on GitLab Pages (which is in some ways better), but then GitLab started serving the wrong SSL cert, so I've migrated here.

Upsides of this migration:

* automatic SSL cert handling
* faster page deployment

Downsides of this migration:

* everything is public
* less deployment flexibility
* no more cryptomining

I don't think there's anything particularly embarrassing in the commit history, so definitely don't bother looking.
